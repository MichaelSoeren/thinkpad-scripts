# About

Scripts for Ubuntu 14.04 (or similar distributions) on Lenovo ThinkPads (tested
on X1 Carbon 2nd Generation).

# Script Description

- `trackpad-fix.sh`: This script builds an updated touchpad driver
    (xserver-xorg-input-evdev) which enables middle clicking for scrolling. The
    driver emulates three trackpad buttons which do not exist on many 2014
    series ThinkPads. Moreover, with the new driver you are able to disable
    movements for part of the touchpad or the complete touchpad to prevent
    accidental pointer movements.
- `trackpoint-fast.sh`: This script speeds up slow TrackPoints.
